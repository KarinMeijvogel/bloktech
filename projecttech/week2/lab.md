## Command Line (I/VI)
The CLI is a means of interacting with a computer program where the users issues commands to the program (in successive lines of text).
Shell: the thing you talk to, the program that handles the interface.
Servers often have a CLI, not a GUI.

**Bash**
Bash is een Unix shell. Bash is a variant of the terminal, just like ZSH. Default login shell for most Linux distributions.

**Enkele commands**

* ls = list all items in this directory
* ls -a = shows hidden (.) files
* cd = change directory (use lower-dash-case)
* clear = empties terminal (doesn't restart anything, just doesn't show previous lines)
* :q! = quit
* sudo = super user do, dangerous!
