# Conclusion
This research shows that people bond with each other based on different social aspects. Happn, for example, focuses on a shared location - while Parship looks at personality traits based on tests. A shared interest, hobby or other aspect seems to be the foundation for every match.

A subject that people often bond over is music: listening together, making music together, attending concerts and talking about artists - these are all good ways to get to know one another. The music someone listens to says something about whats on their mind and how they're feeling. This is why I'm making a dating app, where people get to meet each other based on a similar music tastes.
